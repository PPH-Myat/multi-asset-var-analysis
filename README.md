# Quantitative Risk Modeling: Portfolio VaR Estimation

This project calculates the 1-day 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a mixed asset portfolio containing a SOFR swap and equity positions (AAPL, MSFT, F, BAC), using three major VaR methodologies:

## Methods Implemented

- Parametric VaR (Variance-Covariance)
- Monte Carlo VaR  
  - Full Revaluation  
  - Sensitivity-Based
- Historical VaR  
  - Full Revaluation  
  - Sensitivity-Based

## Portfolio Overview

- 10Y Payer SOFR Swap ($100M notional, 4.2% strike)
- Equity: $1M each in AAPL, MSFT, Ford, and Bank of America

## Data Used

- 1 year of historical SOFR curve data
- Stock price data (31/10/2022 - 30/10/2023)
- Provided Excel-based swap pricer for full revaluation

## How to Run

Coming soon â€” depends on your setup. Add instructions for:
- Notebooks
- Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Any Excel files or macros if applicable
